      <li>2 large eg1 g, beaten</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>3 1/2 cups prepared marinara sauce</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a pot of generously salted water to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, separate broccoli stems and florets. Cut florets in half and
        cut each stem into several pieces lengthwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place stems in the boiling water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Then add
        florets and cook until just barely tender, about 3 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a slotted spoon to transfer broccoli to a bowl of cold water,
        leaving the water boiling on the stove. Let broccoli sit until cool,
        about 2 minutes. Transfer to a colander and let sit until very well
        drained. Leave the bowl of cold water for the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add manicotti to the boiling water and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until tender but slightly undercooked, 6 to 7 minutes. Use
        a slotted spoon to gently transfer manicotti into the bowl of cold
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop cooled, drained broccoli into small pieces. Transfer 3 cups chopped
        broccoli to a mixing bowl and reserve any extra for another use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic, ricotta, provolone, 1 Â¼ cups Parmigiano-Reggiano, eggs,
        salt, cayenne, pepper, and nutmeg to the broccoli. Mix with a spoon
        until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
